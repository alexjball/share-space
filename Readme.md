# Share Space

Make it easy to share a computer remotely with others. Spend less time configuring hardware and more time with people.

Features:
- Low-latency remote desktop viewing and control.
- Configurable resolution and framerate, supporting 1080p30.
- Audio support
- Multiple concurrent viewers
- Pass control between users

# TODO
- Implement a stream using a MediaSource and WebSocket.
- Test sharing a MediaStreamTrack between multiple PeerConnections.
- Test configuring a single-codec offer.
- Is it possible to implement my own MediaStreamTrack?
